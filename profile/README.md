<h1>ðŸŒŸ Welcome to Jeff Bezos on GitHub ðŸŒŸ</h1>

<p>Hello and welcome to our development community at Jeff Bezos! We are dedicated to building innovative and collaborative projects, leveraging the power of open source. To ensure an efficient and orderly workflow, we have established some important rules that all members must follow.</p>

<div>
    <h2>ðŸŒ¿ Branch Rules ðŸŒ¿</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <span>Main Branch (<code>main</code>)</span>:
          <br>The <code>main</code> branch contains production-ready code. All changes here must be stable and fully functional.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Development Branches (<code>develop</code>)</span>: 
          <br>We use a <code>develop</code> branch to integrate new features and improvements. 
          This is the branch where most of the work is done before merging into <code>main</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Feature Branches (<code>feature</code>)</span>: 
          <br>Each new feature or improvement should be developed in a separate branch. Name it <code>feature/feature-name</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>âœ¨ Commit Rules âœ¨</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Clear Messages</span>: 
        <br>Each commit should have a clear and descriptive message. Use the format <code>[Type]: Short description</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Atomic Commits</span>: 
        <br>Make atomic and specific commits. Each commit should represent a unique and functional change.
      </li>
